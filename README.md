# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website project for practicing HTML and creating multiple recipe pages.

## Project Structure

- The root directory contains the main index.html file.
- The "recipes" directory contains individual recipe HTML files.
- The "images" directory holds the images used in the recipe pages.

## Iterations

1. **Initial Structure:**
   - Created index.html with boilerplate HTML.
   - Added an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.

2. **Recipe Page:**
   - Created a "recipes" directory.
   - Added a recipe HTML file (e.g., lasagna.html) with an h1 heading for the recipe name.
   - Linked the recipe page from the index.html using an anchor tag.

3. **Recipe Page Content:**
   - Added an image of the dish, a description, ingredients list, and steps to the recipe page.
   - Followed the structure: Image -> Description -> Ingredients -> Steps.

4. **Add More Recipes:**
   - Added two more recipe HTML files with the same structure as the initial recipe page.
   - Linked the new recipe pages from the index.html within an unordered list.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the main recipe index.
